The questions and the report can be fround in the `doc` folder.

The `Q-learning.ipynb` notebook is the runs for the Questions 1 to 10.
This notebooks uses the `tic_env.py`, `tic_plot.py`, `performance_measures.py`, `q_table.py` and `policies.py` files.

The `Deep_Q_Learning.ipynb` notebook is the runs for the Questions 11 to 19. This notebooks uses the `tic_env.py`, `tic_plot.py`, `deep_performance_measures.py` and `deep_utils.py` files.

The `T_train_calculation.ipynb` notebook is the runs for the Questions 20 to 21.
